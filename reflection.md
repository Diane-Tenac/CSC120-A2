Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 
I have found it helpful crafting my draft n a paper first. This has helped me getting some ideas as the foundatin of what needed to be done. Again I have been leaving commenets that helped me to proceed with the assignment as if I had a partner I was sharing my ideas with. This was so helpful.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
having a draft has worked. And an idea of doing what you can at a time helped me. again it's okay to keep editing. I write whatever I think makes some sort of sense and then keep revisiting it to get some new ideas for modification.
